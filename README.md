# OpinionTally: Twitter Sentiment Analysis on Vaccination Opinions

Flask web app that performs sentiment analysis on vaccination-related tweets/opinions using **NLTK VADER**. Frontend uses **Bootstrap 5** and **Chart.js**. All history is stored locally in the browser's `localStorage` (no database, no authentication).

## Features
* **Analysis:** Paste multiple tweets/opinions (one per line) on the Home page.
* **Sentiment Engine:** Uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) for accurate social media sentiment scoring.
* **Visualization:** Displays a responsive Chart.js chart showing the overall sentiment distribution (Positive / Neutral / Negative).
* **Summary:** Shows the overall compound score, sentiment counts, and identifies the **top 3 most positive** and **top 3 most negative** opinions.
* **Local History:** The most recent analysis result is **automatically saved to browser `localStorage` upon page refresh** or successful completion of a new analysis.
* **History Page:** Lists all past analyses stored in your browser, including summary details and a link to view input and scores.
